<p>Alrighty, then &hellip; picture this if you will.</p>
<p>10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes,<br>
in my &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; pose, just outside of Area 51<br>
Contemplating the whole &ldquo;chosen people&rdquo; thingy<br>
when a flaming stealth banana split the sky<br>
like one would hope but never really expect<br>
to see in a place like this.<br>
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime<br>
and stopping right at my Birkenstocks,<br>
and me yelping&hellip;</p>
<p>Holy fucking shit!</p>
<p>Then the X-Files being,<br>
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan<br>
with Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of<br>
vanilla Chig Champa<br>
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent<br>
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel<br>
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw,<br>
and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip,<br>
and all I could think was:<br>
&ldquo;I hope Uncle Martin here doesn&rsquo;t notice<br>
that I pissed my fuckin&rsquo; pants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So light in his way,<br>
Like an apparition, that<br>
He had me crying out,<br>
&ldquo;Fuck me<br>
It&rsquo;s gotta be<br>
the Deadhead Chemistry<br>
The blotter got right on top of me<br>
Got me seein&rsquo; E-motherfuckin&rsquo;-T!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after calming me down<br>
with some orange slices<br>
and some fetal spooning,<br>
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose.<br>
He said, &ldquo;You are the Chosen One,<br>
the One who will deliver the message.<br>
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it<br>
and a warning for those who do not.&rdquo;<br>
Me. The Chosen One?<br>
They chose me!!!<br>
And I didn&rsquo;t even graduate from fuckin&rsquo; high school.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better&hellip;<br>
You&rsquo;d better&hellip;<br>
You&rsquo;d better&hellip;<br>
You&rsquo;d better listen.</p>
<p>Then he looked right through me<br>
With somniferous almond eyes<br>
Don&rsquo;t even know what that means<br>
Must remember to write it down<br>
This is so real<br>
Like the time Dave floated away<br>
See, my heart is pounding<br>
&lsquo;Cause this shit never happens to me</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t breathe right now!</p>
<p>It was so real,<br>
Like I woke up in Wonderland.<br>
All sorta terrifying<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna be all alone<br>
While I tell this story.<br>
And can anyone tell me why<br>
Y&rsquo;all sound like Peanuts parents?<br>
Will I ever be coming down?<br>
This is so real<br>
Finally, it&rsquo;s my lucky day<br>
See, my heart is racing<br>
&lsquo;Cause this shit never happens to me</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t breathe right now!</p>
<p>You believe me, don&rsquo;t you?<br>
Please believe what I&rsquo;ve just said!<br>
See the Dead ain&rsquo;t touring<br>
And this wasn&rsquo;t all in my head.<br>
See, they took me by the hand<br>
And invited me right in.<br>
Then they showed me something<br>
I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin.</p>
<p>Strapped down to my bed<br>
Feet cold and eyes red<br>
I&rsquo;m out of my head<br>
Am I alive? Am I dead?<br>
Can&rsquo;t remember what they said<br>
God damn, shit the bed.</p>
<p>Hey &hellip;</p>
<p>Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position.<br>
Such a heavy burden now to be the One<br>
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending,<br>
To write it down for all the world to see.</p>
<p>But I forgot my pen<br>
Shit the bed again &hellip;<br>
Typical.</p>
<p>Strapped down to my bed<br>
Feet cold and eyes red<br>
I&rsquo;m out of my head<br>
Am I alive? Am I dead?<br>
Sunkist and Sudafed<br>
Gyroscopes and infrared<br>
Won&rsquo;t help, I&rsquo;m brain dead<br>
Can&rsquo;t remember what they said<br>
God damn, shit the bed</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what they said to me<br>
Can&rsquo;t remember what they said to make me out to be a hero<br>
Can&rsquo;t remember what they said<br>
Bob help me!<br>
Can&rsquo;t remember what they said</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, and we won&rsquo;t know (x12)</p>
<p>God damn, shit the bed!</p>
