I know the pieces fit  
'Cause I watched them fall away  
Mildewed and smouldering  
Fundamental differing  
Pure intention juxtaposed  
Will set two lovers' souls in motion  
Disintegrating as it goes  
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then  
Has burned a hole between us so  
We cannot seem to reach an end  
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit  
'Cause I watched them tumble down  
No fault, none to blame  
It doesn't mean I don't desire  
To point the finger, blame the other  
Watch the temple topple over  
To bring the pieces back together  
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from  
The squaring off between  
And the circling is worth it  
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit  
But I watched them fall away  
Mildewed and smouldering  
Strangled by our coveting  
I've done the math enough to know  
The dangers of our second guessing  
Doomed to crumble unless we grow  
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has  
A tendency to  
Atrophy any  
Sense of compassion

Between supposed lovers  
Between supposed lovers

I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
I know the pieces fit  
And I know the pieces fit
