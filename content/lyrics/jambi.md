Here from the king's mountain view  
Here from the wild dream come true  
Feast like a sultan, I do  
On treasures and flesh never few

But I, I would wish it all away  
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

The devil and his had me down  
In love with the dark side I'd found  
Dabblin' all the way down  
Up to my neck, soon to drown  
But you changed that all for me  
Lifted me up, turned me round

So I  
I  
I  
I  
I would  
I would  
I would  
Wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn  
Begged like a hooker all night long  
Tempted the devil with my song  
And got what I wanted all along

But I  
And I would  
If I could  
And I would  
Wish it away  
Wish it away  
Wish it all away  
Wanna wish it all away  
No prize that could hold sway  
Or justify my giving away my center

So if I could I'd wish it all away  
If I thought tomorrow would take you away  
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center  
Just trying to hold on one more day

Damn my eyes!  
Damn my eyes!  
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum  
Wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone

Shine on forever  
Shine on benevolent sun  
Shine down upon the broken  
Shine until the two become one

Shine on forever  
Shine on benevolent sun  
Shine down upon the severed  
Shine until the two become one

Divided, I'll wither away  
Divided, I'll wither away  
Shine down upon the many  
Light our way, benevolent sun

Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
So as one survive  
Another day and season  
Silence, legion, save your poison  
Silence, legion, stay out of my way
